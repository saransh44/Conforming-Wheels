# Conforming-Wheels
 
These wheels were made for my robotics team as a way to improve the standard shooter design and have a more efficient transfer of energy. 

This repo just serves as an easy to access directory to view our engineering notebook that documents the project.

If you would like to see the CAD of the work, open the link attached in the description of the repo and then navigate to 
CAD and Design > Wheel Laucher Design V1. All the entries in this subdirectory document the transformation and final evolution of the idea from start to finish. 

If you would like to see how we handled coding the shooter and stabilizing it with our Kalman filter and PID calculations, consider navigating to the Software and Robot Control Section > Kalman Filter/RPM Calculations Sub-Section. All entries in this subdirectory should give you an idea of how hard we worked at trying to produce more accurate results by getting the shooter system to perform at a consistent RPM.
